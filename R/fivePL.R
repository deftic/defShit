#' Five parameters logistic regression
#'
#' @param a  the minimum value that can be obtained (i.e. what happens at 0 dose)
#' @param b  Hillâ€™s slope of the curve (i.e. this is related to the steepness of the curve at point c)
#' @param c  the point of inflection (i.e. the point on the S shaped curve halfway between a and d)
#' @param d  the maximum value that can be obtained (i.e. what happens at infinite dose)
#' @param m  Asymmetry factor. When m=1 we have a symmetrical curve around inflection point and so we have a four-parameters logistic equation.
#' @param y  deltaF / F
